# rubber-pico-duck

My template as a basis for using a tiny 2040 as a usb rubber duck. It is based off files from the following sources:

* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle (lib directory, unmodified, [MIT License](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/main/LICENSE))
* https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky (code.py, modified [GNU General Public License v2.0](https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky/blob/main/LICENSE))

Just copy the files to the root directory of a Pimoroni Tiny 2040 running CircuitPython 8, and replace the `payload.dd` with your own rubber ducky payload
